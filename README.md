Description
-----------
The program is a simple *Attendence System*.

I have written the attendence system using Angular 2, bootstrap (front end), node js (server side).
Currently I have mock the data at server side (node js) because else it require some database like MYSQL.
But I have added the SQL(mysql_data.sql) which can be use at server side after DB setup to server data with small code change and one line angular service change.
Also, the employee name passed from the parent component, can be change to some other screen for selecting employee, currently it is default as 'Saurabh'.


For Running:
------------------------
1. npm install
2. npm run build 
3. node index
